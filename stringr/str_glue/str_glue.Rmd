### stringr::str_glue()

How can we easily include column names as values in a table?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

As of 2018 February, the **stringr** package has a *str_glue* function to accomplish this task.  This function allows for "expressions enclosed by braces will be evaluated as R code".  

```{r}
mtcars %>% head()
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% mutate(Label = str_glue("Miles Per Gallon: {mpg} - Cylinders: {cyl}")) %>% head()
```

See details here: <https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_glue.html>
